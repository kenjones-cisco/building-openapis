## Start Development

Now that you have your API definition using the OpenAPI Specification, you are ready to get started
with development.


### Server / API Implementation

Generate a server stub and start implementing business logic, as the boilerplate plumbing
is already done.


### UI / Clients

If you have a UI or other teams planning to leverage your API then you can generate a fully
functional client for the programming language they need. This allows other teams to start
working while you build you the implementation.


### Documentation

Publish the API documentation using Swagger UI or generating HTML, Markdown, Asciidoc, etc. to
allow others to preview what is coming as well as provide feedback.


The best part is that as you make changes to your API definition, you can regenerate the Server, Clients, and Documentation.
